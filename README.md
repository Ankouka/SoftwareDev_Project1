This is the first software project I worked on with my team in our Software Devlopment project.
Here is the decription of this software project:

**Windoors** is a small company that builds windows and doors that can be ordered by pre-registered resellers. The company wants to simplify the process by which resellers enter new purchase orders. Your team has been hired to implement a web app that meets the requirements described in this document.

Considering that the requirements for the **Windoors** web app are well understood and that the size of the project is relatively small, it was determined that the **waterfall** process model will be used in the development of this system. Each phase of the project is described in more detail next. The project is to build a web app that allows Windoors's resellers to place new orders for doors and windows. The web app will simplify how orders are placed and, consequentially, increase the company's revenue. 

## Objectives 

* Simplify how orders are placed.
* Manage and track orders.
* Maintain the products catalog.

## Features 

1. Users (resellers and admin) must be able to authenticate themselves. 
2. Resselers must be able to place new orders through the platform.
3. Resselers must be able to track their own orders. 
4. Admin users must be able to change the status of any order. 
5. Admin users should be able to update the products catalog. 

## Contraints 

* A working version with all required functionalities (the ones specified with a **must**) is expected to be delivered in 2 weeks. 
* The implementation team must have from 3 to 5 members. 
* The software must be implemented in **Python** and based on **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**. 
* **SQLite** can be chosen as the database.
